# QuestionOfTimeAndSpace
This repository contains the models and analysis that were used for the paper "A question of time and space: A model approach to the synchronicity of gypsum and halite during the Messinian Salinity Crisis" by Ronja Ebner and Paul Meijer.

## Scripts:
### Modeling:
- Configuration_A1.py
- Configuration_A2.py
- Configuration_B.py
- Configuration_B+.py

### Analysing:
- Analysis_A1.py
- Analysis_A2.py
- Analysis_B.py

  
## Folder structure:
### DATA:
This folder contains two sets of results. The one with the suffix _mini is the one that would be produced with the current settings of the 'Configuration_*.py' files. The set without this suffix has a higher resolution for g and e, but is otherwise identical.

### FIGURES:
Figures that are created by the scripts
- Configuration_B+.py,
- Analysis_A1.py,
- Analysis_A2.py and
- Analysis_B.py
will be saved to this directory
